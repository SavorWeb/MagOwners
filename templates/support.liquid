		<h1>Free PMS from Magnuson Hotels</h1>
		<p>

<p>Why struggle with separate hotel operating systems? In most cases, the PMS, CRS (central reservation system), accounting and reporting don't connect with each other.</p> 

<p>Affiliate your hotel with Magnuson Hotels and benefit from a free PMS with one consolidated operating system that unites front desk, reservation system and brand into one low cost and easy to use mobile and Internet dashboard. </p>

<p>All GDS and OTA reservations will automatically download to the front desk, so remote and mobile devices can access rooms sold, occupancy, source of booking and ADR all in one place.</p> 

<h3>Introducing PMS1 from Magnuson Worldwide. Not only is it free, but we give you money back.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Free web based hotel PMS upon affiliation with Magnuson Hotels.</li>
